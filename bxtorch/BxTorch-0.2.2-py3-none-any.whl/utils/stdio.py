class ProgressBar:
    """
    The progress bar can be used to print progress for a specific task where
    N work items have to be processed. The progress bar also measures the
    execution time and provides an estimated remaining time for the  operation.

    A common use case for the progress bar are for-loops where one work item is
    completed per iteration. The progress bar is intended to be used either 
    from within a with statement or a for-loop.
